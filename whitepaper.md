**VIKTOKEN WHITEPAPER**

---

**Introduction**

VIKTOKEN is a community-driven meme token designed not only to parody the global rise of populist and corrupt politics, but also to channel that satire into something meaningful: support for children’s hospitals and charitable causes worldwide.

We believe that blockchain can empower both activism and generosity — turning humor into hope, and memes into meaning.

---

**Mission**

Our mission is twofold:

1. To raise awareness about global political corruption through humorous, meme-based activism.
2. To use a portion of our token’s growth and liquidity to support real-world causes — specifically, donating to children in need.
